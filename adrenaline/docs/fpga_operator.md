# Xilinx FPGA Operator

CableLabs has developed an example operator that installs Xilinx FPGA kernel drivers and the Xilinx-developed device plugin for Kubernetes.

Currently this operator is specific to a particular hardware and software configuration and serves as an example of how to develop an operator to more easily deploy hardware acceleration in SNAPSâ„¢-Kubernetes and other Kubernetes environments.

See the [project repository](https://github.com/cablelabs/xilinx-operator) for more information on how to utilize this operator.
